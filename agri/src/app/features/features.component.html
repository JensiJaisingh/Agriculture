    <h2>Virtual Farm</h2>
    <p>When you are aware of pests and diseases, as well as of the means to be used, it allows you to make an operational decision to save the crop and reduce costs.</p>
    
      <p> You can conduct a survey of the field using virtual reality. It is easier for farmers to determine the quality of the soil, to pick up the appropriate crops, and effectively use the soil potential for crop production.</p> 
        
       <p> How is it implemented? Sensors are being installed in the field, and they scan the crop. An agronomist needs only to bring a tablet or a smartphone to the plant, and he/she receives information about the weather, temperature, plant health, fertilizer needs, and the date of harvesting.</p>
